Snippets, Notes, and Stack Overflow references, related to the material in the book 'Structure and Implementation of Computer Programs in Python'

Reference to the book - http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/sp12/book/ and related course - http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/sp12/

The notes are chapter wise and contain: 

- Functional Programming basics, Recursion, Higher order functions, constraint programming, asbstraction and combination.
- Data Abstaction, Implementation of python tuples, lists, dictionaries using Functional Programming
- OOP, Implementation of Classes,  Objects using dictionaries and closures.
- Recursive Data Structures, Hierarchial Data Structures, O(n) Notation, Exceptions
- Interpreters for languages with combination
- Interpreters for languates with abstraction
- Distributd and Parallel Computing
- Sequences and Coroutines

I highly recommend reading this book for developing a good understanding of how a programming language is built, how it works and what are its features. This is not a book for learning Python, it contains very little syntactic study.
